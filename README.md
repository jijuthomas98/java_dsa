## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

Inside `src` we have divided into topics, each topic folder will have basic sample code and a markdown file for concept explanation
